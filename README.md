# Welcome to AutoDev Vault

Hi, I'm Mahija ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m working on an application built with **Flutter** and **Dart**. This app integrates **.md (Markdown)** files from my GitHub repository to dynamically display content related to **Model-Based Development** and various other automotive engineering topics.

## About the App

The **AutoDev Vault** app is designed to provide a categorized collection of resources and interview questions in the automotive industry, focusing on Model-Based Development, AUTOSAR, Code-Based Development, Software Quality, Tools & Scripting, Testing & Safety, and System Design.

### Features
